### [New York](http://www.meetup.com/Meteor-NY/events/212304662/)
Great meetup in NYC.  100+ attendees.  The live coding demo was well received and show & tell had a good mix of simple and polished apps. 

We did our 8pm video chat with MDG; a little late getting started and the video chat app's sound setup was kinda funky but still a good experience. A bit more networking and local Q&A after that.

Most people had already tried meteor.  Very few windows users.  Large interest in hosting / scaling.
